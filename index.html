        1.What is hook? Write one example.   ?
        Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and
         other React features without writing a class. This new function 
         useState is the first “Hook” we'll 
        learn about, 

         example:
         import React,{useState} from 'react';
         export hook=()=>{
            const [name,setName]=useState("sanjeev")
            return(
                < div> name </ div>
            )
         }

         2.What is props ?    
         In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where
          the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The
           word “props” implies “properties”, and its 
           working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes.
            Basically, these props components are read-only components.19

        3.What is state?
        What Is 'State' in ReactJS? The state is a built-in 
        React object that is used to contain data or information 
        about the component. A component's state can change over time;
         whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

         4.Write one example of state update? 
         example:
         import React,{useState} from 'react';
         export hook=()=>{
            const [name,setName]=useState("sanjeev")
            return(
                < div> {setName('chandru')} </ div>
            )
         }

         5.Difference between function and class component.  ?

         function:
         A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).

         There is no render method used in functional components.

         Functional components run from top to bottom and once the function is returned it can’t be kept alive.

         Constructors are not used.

         class:
         A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function that returns a React element.
         It must have the render() method returning JSX (which is syntactically similar to HTML)
         The class component is instantiated and different life cycle method is kept alive and is run and invoked depending on the phase of the class component.
         Constructor is used as it needs to store state.
